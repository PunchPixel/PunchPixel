- 👋 Hi, I’m @PunchPixel, currently CTO for a major Medical Training Center in Europe.
- 👀 I’m interested in Medical Training and CRM systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Sources Projects related to Digital Learning or Passwords Manager or CRM. Whey ? Because these are 3 fields I see my team deal everyday with our clients for years. I guess I can say I am an expert on these problematics from the client side.

- ⚡ Fun fact: In 1986, I was 12 and my dad didn't want me to have a computer because he thought it was going to be useless.
